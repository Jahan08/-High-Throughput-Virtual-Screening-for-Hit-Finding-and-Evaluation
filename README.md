•	Absorption: The movement of a compound/drug from the site of administration to the bloodstream. This process involves several phases and depends upon the method of delivery (oral, topical, intravenous etc.). Lipinski's rule of 5 famously predicts that poor absorption is more likely when there are more than 5 hydrogen bond donors, 10 hydrogen bond acceptors, a molecular weight greater than 500 and a calculated LogP greater than 5.

•	Chemical stability: The stability of a drug is critical to efficacy, as the loss of a drug through a chemical reaction will result in reduction of potency and may result in degradation into a toxic substance. To learn more about chemical stability of drug substances, read this chapter from the Stability of Drugs and Dosage Forms.

# MODULE-1: Some terms to understand

•	Directed screen: A type of high-throughput screen that tests large compound libraries with user-intervention involved in the selecting of compound chemotypes.

•	DNA encoded libraries (DEL): A technology for the synthesis and screening of large collections of small molecule compounds by the conjugation of chemical compounds or building blocks to short DNA fragments that serve as identification bar codes through PCR amplification. To learn more, read through the DEL Wikipedia page that is very well written

•	Drug discovery pipeline: The process by which hits are identified, optimized to leads, and leads are tested for suitability as new chemical entities (NCEs). The NCEs are validated before approval by the FDA.

•	Fragment Based Drug Discovery: A series of methods in drug discovery that use small organic molecules which are small in size and low in molecular weight and may bind only weakly to the biological target (protein), and then grow them or combine them to produce a lead compound with a higher affinity. To learn more, read this introduction to fragment-based drug discovery by Carmot Therapeutics.

•	Free energy perturbation (FEP): An alchemical approach that uses molecular dynamics simulations or Monte Carlo methods to compute the free energy differences between two ligands in solution and in a protein binding site. To learn about the industry standard FEP+ technology read the Schrödinger webpage. To learn more about how this method has been successful in predicting GPCR binding affinities, see this high-level video or read the corresponding Open Access article.

•	Hit: A small molecule that is known to inhibit or bind to a target in drug discovery. Most times, this hit molecule does not have optimized properties or high enough affinity to fully satisfy the needs of a project. Functional groups on the hit are usually altered to address this in what will become a lead molecule. 

•	Lead ( or Core) Hopping: the identification of molecular structures that have the same functional inhibition of a given target with significantly different molecular backbones or core moieties.

•	Ligand-based virtual screening: Using the structure and chemical properties of a hit ligand or series of ligands to assess compounds as potential binders on the computer.

•	Metabolic stability: The stability of a drug within a cellular environment, as many metabolic enzymes within our cells (p450s, oxidases, aldo-ketoreductases, esterases, conjugases etc), are able to degrade drugs into other compounds thus reducing potency and potentially creating toxic substances. To read more on metabolic stability in drug discovery, read this article from Millenium: The Takeda Oncology company.

•	Random screen: A type of high-throughput screen that tests large compound libraries without user-intervention involved in selecting compound chemotypes.

•	Safety: Drug safety is important to assess, including side effects due to off-target effects, as well as toxicity issues that arise from chemical and metabolic instability. To read more on common methods for assessing drug safety, see this Nature correspondence.

•	Solubility in drug discovery: A measure of how well a small molecule dissolves in the blood, usually predicted through the solubility coefficient of a compound in water versus octanol. For more background on the relationship between solubility and physicochemical properties, see this American Pharmaceutical Review article.

•	Structure-activity relationship (SAR): A relationship that is built based on analyzing multiple compounds with similar cores but different functional groups to understand the impact that chemical structure changes have on the activity of the compound against a target.

•	Structure-based drug design (SBDD): Using the information present in a macromolecule or protein structure to identify hits and optimize drug-like properties.

•	Structure-based virtual screening: Using the structure and chemical properties of a binding site on a macromolecule or protein target to assess compounds as potential binders on the computer.

•	Target: A macromolecule (most commonly a protein) that will be targeted by a small molecule in a drug discovery project. Often the small molecule will cause some conformational change or lock the macromolecule into a particular conformation and thus affect that macromolecule's activity and downstream signaling pathways.
